Methods & MetaScience is a journal club and discussion group organized by the School of Psychology & Neuroscience at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). Meetings are every week on Wednesdays from 16:00 to 17:00 UK time on Zoom. [Coding Club](coding_club.html) meets every other Wednesday from 14:00 to 15:00.

In addition to talks, we also run training events. If you would like to present or run a training workshop, please let [Lisa](mailto://lisa.debruine@glasgow.ac.uk) know!

Some of our events are open to the public and the zoom link will be posted here if so. Contact [Lisa](mailto://lisa.debruine@glasgow.ac.uk) for access to the Teams channel that has the recordings and zoom links for non-public events if you are University of Glasgow staff or student.

For a dynamically updated list of talks that you can subscribe to, please see [the events list](https://samoa.dcs.gla.ac.uk/events/series.jsp?series=141).
