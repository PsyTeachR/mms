Methods & MetaScience is a journal club and discussion group organized by the School of Psychology & Neuroscience at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). Meetings are every Wednesday from 12:00 to 13:00 UK time on Zoom. [Coding Club](coding_club.html) meets every Wednesday from 16:05 to 17:00.

In addition to talks, we also run training events. If you would like to present or run a training workshop, please let [Dale](mailto://dale.barr@glasgow.ac.uk) know!

Some of our events are open to the public and the zoom link will be posted here if so. Contact [Dale](mailto://dale.barr@glasgow.ac.uk) for access to the Teams channel that has the recordings and zoom links for non-public events if you are University of Glasgow staff or student.

For a dynamically updated list of talks that you can subscribe to, please see the events list for [M&Ms](https://samoa.dcs.gla.ac.uk/events/series.jsp?series=141) or [Coding Club](https://samoa.dcs.gla.ac.uk/events/series.jsp?series=189).
