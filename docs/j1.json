This assumption is violated in datasets where there is temporal autocorrelation among the residuals. Recently, Baayen, Vasishth, Kliegl, and Bates (2017) presented evidence for autocorrelation in three psycholinguistic datasets, and showed how Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) can be used to model these autocorrelation patterns. However, there is currently little understanding of the impact of autocorrelation on model performance, and the extent to which GAMMs improve (or impair) inference. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we found that mixed-effects models perform well in the face of autocorrelation, except when autocorrelation is confounded with treatment variance. GAMMs did little to improve power, and in fact, the use of factor smooths dramatically impaired power for detecting effects of any between-subjects factors. These results suggest GAMMs are only needed in special cases.","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2018-10-03T18:15:01Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":15450,"title":"Writing Registered Reports","startTime":"2018-10-24T13:00","endTime":"2018-10-24T14:00","speaker":"Ben Jones","speakerAffiliation":"","speakerUrl":"","description":"Publication bias distorts the scientific record and can give a false impression of the robustness of published results.

Rather than attempting to capture a health behaviour with general items that abstract over relevant situations (as in standard self-report instruments), SAM^2 assesses two situated dimensions.  First, SAM^2 establishes the specific situations associated with an individual’s behaviour in a health domain.  Second, SAM^2 samples features from the situated action cycle that attempt to predict the behaviour across situations.  As a result, SAM^2 establishes overall measures of a health behaviour grounded directly in situational experience, along with features of the situated action cycle that predict the behaviour.  In recent studies, we have found that SAM^2 does an excellent job of predicting health behaviours associated with habits, eating, stress, and trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling).  Using mixed effects models, SAM^2 typically explains 60 to 80% of the variance at the group level and more variance at the individual level, demonstrating large systematic individual differences.  In addition, SAM^2 represents individual differences in an explicit manner that has potential for supporting individuals as they understand and work with a health behaviour.  Issues associated with causality, explicit vs. implicit measures, and external validity are important to address.","location":{"id":90,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 6, Meeting Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":90,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2018-10-12T18:15:02Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":15492,"title":"LexOPS: A Web App for Stimulus Generation in Psycholinguistics","startTime":"2018-12-05T14:00","endTime":"2018-12-05T15:00","speaker":"Jack Taylor","speakerAffiliation":"","speakerUrl":"","description":"A common problem in designing Psychology experiments that use word stimuli is that they often require labour-intensive methods of stimulus generation, to ensure that specific prelexical, lexical, and semantic features are suitably controlled for.

Very often, they assume that research consists of confirmatory hypothesis tests and that 'questionable research practices' are ways in which researchers cut corners to present evidence in favour of hypotheses that may in fact be false. Two increasingly popular methods to prevent this from happening are preregistration and Registered Reports: Both require that authors state their hypotheses and analysis plan before conducting their study, which is supposed to prevent twisting the data to fit the narrative (e.g. p-hacking) or twisting the narrative to fit the data (hypothesising after results are known). In theory, this practice safeguards the validity of inferences drawn from hypothesis tests by removing any 'wiggle room' authors could exploit to produce spurious positive results. In practice, many psychologists seem to struggle to fit their research into this revised, now much more narrow framework of confirmatory hypothesis testing: Preregistration has been accused of stifling creativity, is described as difficult even by its proponents, and analyses of published preregistrations show that most do not sufficiently restrict the above-mentioned wiggle room.\n\nI want to argue that by making the very strict requirements of a confirmatory hypothesis test so explicit, preregistration and Registered Reports reveal that hypothesis testing may be the wrong tool for a substantial number of research questions in psychology. The conflation of exploratory and confirmatory research that psychologists have been used to may have stifled the development of a framework for high-quality exploratory research, which is the necessary basis for developing hypotheses in the first place. As such, resistance against preregistration and some of the growing pains the format is experiencing may simply be a consequence of it laying bare the misfit between research goals and the excessive focus on hypothesis testing in psychology. If this is true, psychologists may be well advised to shift this focus and work towards better literacy in the exploratory ground work that precedes confirmatory hypothesis tests.","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2019-09-29T18:15:01Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":16376,"title":"Take a picture, it'll last longer: Practical and ethical considerations on using visual methods in qualitative research","startTime":"2019-10-22T13:00","endTime":"2019-10-22T14:00","speaker":"Dr. Jo Neary & Kathryn Machray","speakerAffiliation":"School of Education, University of Glasgow","speakerUrl":"","description":"For many people, taking and sharing photographs is an everyday behaviour, and is a way of sharing parts of your life (and your identity) with friends and family.

Over the past five years, nearly 300 research assistants have transcribed and coded participants&rsquo; behaviors and environments from over 300,000 EAR audio files. To provide two examples of questions that can only be answered by capturing actual behavior alongside ESM self-reports, I will describe two projects that have resulted from this dataset: 1) Do people have self-knowledge of their momentary personality states, and 2) What are people doing when they miss experience sampling reports? I will conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of implementing open practices with this highly-identifiable and repeatedly-used dataset.</p>","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2020-02-26T11:56:22Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":"","enlightenUrl":" ","intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":16746,"title":"Building reflexivity into your qualitative research. \"I think, therefore I am.\"","startTime":"2020-03-11T14:00","endTime":"2020-03-11T15:00","speaker":"Kate Reid","speakerAffiliation":"School of Education, University of Glasgow","speakerUrl":"https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/education/staff/katereid/","description":"","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2020-01-16T18:15:01Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":16963,"title":"Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Workshop","startTime":"2020-03-25T12:00","endTime":"2020-03-25T13:00","speaker":"Cyril Pernet & Ruud Hortensius","speakerAffiliation":"University of Edinburgh & University of Glasgow","speakerUrl":"","description":"Will be re-scheduled for some future date","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2020-03-10T00:15:02Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":16933,"title":"Jingle-Jangle Fallacies: What they are and how to avoid them","startTime":"2020-04-22T13:00","endTime":"2020-04-22T14:00","speaker":"David Aikman","speakerAffiliation":"University of Glasgow","speakerUrl":"","description":"","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2020-02-27T13:45:35Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":17054,"title":"Gelfert (2016), \"How to Do Science with Models\", Chapters 1 to 3 (pp. 1-70)","startTime":"2020-05-01T14:30","endTime":"2020-05-01T15:30","speaker":"Group Discussion","speakerAffiliation":"","speakerUrl":"","description":"For this Zoom meeting, the host will provide a quick summary of Gelfert (2016), \"How to Do Science with Models\", Chapters 1 to 3 (pp. 1-70).

Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams. Nature (2020). \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2314-9\n\nAbstract: \"Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.\"\n\nKatarina Moravkova will provide a summary of the paper at the start of the session.","location":{"id":54,"location":"Other/unknown","directions":null,"mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":54,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2020-05-21T18:15:01Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":"Zoom (see M&Ms channel on Teams for link)","valid":true},{"id":17089,"title":"Reconsidering population inference from a prevalence perspective","startTime":"2020-06-05T14:30","endTime":"2020-06-05T15:30","speaker":"Robin Ince","speakerAffiliation":"University of Glasgow","speakerUrl":"","description":"Within neuroscience, psychology and neuroimaging, it is typical to run an experiment on a sample of participants and then apply statistical tools to quantify and infer an effect of the experimental manipulation in the population from which the sample was drawn. Whereas the current focus is on average effects (i.e. the population mean, assuming a normal distribution [1]), it is equally valid to ask the alternative question of how typical is the effect in the population[2]? That is, we infer an effect in each individual participant in the sample, and from that infer the prevalence of the effect in the population[3–6]. We propose a novel Bayesian method to estimate such population prevalence, based on within-participant null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Applying Bayesian population prevalence estimation in studies sufficiently powered for NHST within individual participants could address many of the issues recently raised regarding replicability[7].  Bayesian prevalence provides a population level inference currently missing for designs with small numbers of participants, such as traditional psychophysics or animal electrophysiology[8,9]. Since Bayesian prevalence delivers a quantitative estimate with associated uncertainty, it avoids reducing an entire experiment to a binary inference on a population mean[10].\n \n1.

This can be partially attributed to sub-optimal experimental designs, yet it is in large part also due to the inherent differences between people and populations. When an experiment is done, and disproportionate consideration is given to how well results can translate between different occasions, raters, tests or any number of potential facets, the likelihood that the findings are reliable decreases greatly. One way to quantify this is through Generalizability Theory (GT), which analyzes how much variance in results can be attributed to any chosen facets of generalization through considering both main and interaction effects. Recently it has been used in repeated measures experiments to determine whether tests, subscales or even individual items measure states or traits in individuals through a signal-noise ratio calculation named the Trait Component Index (TCI).\n\nIn this talk I will first go through the basic precepts and theories underlying GT, and then focus primarily on the breath of application to research in psychology. I will demonstrate this through a brief range of results in previous studies and will then cover the results from my own dissertation in greater detail. Finally, and perhaps most importantly I will outline some of the current limitations of GT and consider alternative methods in an effort to avoid replacing one default analysis with another, but instead highlight the advantages of a broader methodological repertoire in research.\n\nSome optional background reading Casper has suggested:\n\nBloch, R., & Norman, G.

You might know that linear mixed effects models let you look at subject/item variability with random intercepts and slopes, but what if you want to model more than just the mean? What if you want to know how subjects/items differ in variance? Have no fear, Bayesian estimation is here! With Bayesian estimation you can build a single model that estimates the effect of your predictors on any parameters of whatever distribution your data takes. Throw in some random effects and hey presto! You've got a mixed effects model with distributional parameters. I'll show an example of a model estimating the same maximal random effects structure for multiple distributional parameters of a non-Gaussian (shifted log-normal) distribution, which lets us look at subject/item variability of the intercepts and slopes of each parameter.\n\nThis paper shows some advantages of such models in accurately estimating effects and subject variability, and makes some interesting links to the large/small N debate:\n\nRouder, J.

Being able to reproduce the work is a key component of easily validating an analysis, as well as extending the work. Reproducibility is not as simple, however, as sharing the code and data that produced our analysis. We must consider how our data and algorithms are understood, variables defined, etc. Our code needs to be accessible and interoperable. There is much guidance about best practice, but this is often overwhelming for those of us who are not from formal computer science training. In this talk I share the story of how I attempted good enough practice in my doctoral thesis, and found even this was simply too much to achieve. Indeed, despite failing to achieve good enough scientific practice in any aspect of reproducibility, I discovered a delightful world of scientific workflows in R that make every day just that bit easier now. Failing at reproducible science in R is the best we can aim for; we will never achieve best practice in every aspect of reproducibility, and if we failed, then we tried.

Though not intentional nor malicious, there are many social elements that contribute to these chronic under-representations in computer science classrooms across all academic levels. By investigating alternative paths to broaden participation in computing, we interviewed folks from underrepresented groups in computing and found that many people thought computer science classes were too boring, too hard, and had specific stereotypes about what “counts” as computer science in the first place. Instead, many of our participants had learned their computational skills from working on fun projects as part of a fan community. This talk explores what some of those projects are, why they were motivating to our participants, and what it might look like to bring projects from fandom into the classroom.\n\nRelevant paper: https://cmci.colorado.edu/~cafi5706/SIGCSE2021_ComputationalLabor.pdf","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2021-03-10T12:15:02Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":17742,"title":"Coding Club Shiny Quiz 4","startTime":"2021-04-28T13:00","endTime":"2021-04-28T14:00","speaker":"Lisa DeBruine","speakerAffiliation":"University of Glasgow","speakerUrl":"https://psyteachr.github.io/shiny-tutorials/coding_club.html","description":"https://psyteachr.github.io/shiny-tutorials/coding_club.html","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2021-03-25T12:15:01Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":17740,"title":"Global Engagement Task Force","startTime":"2021-05-05T13:00","endTime":"2021-05-05T14:00","speaker":"Crystal Steltenpohl, James Montilla Doble, Dana Basnight-Brown","speakerAffiliation":"Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science","speakerUrl":"https://psyarxiv.com/4upqd","description":"<p>The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/4upqd\">Global Engagement Task Force Report</a> outlines several suggestions, specifically around building partnerships with geographically diverse open science organizations; increasing SIPS presence at other, more local events; diversifying remote events; considering geographically diverse annual conference locations; improving membership and financial resources; and surveying open science practitioners from geographically diverse regions.</p>\n\n<p>Three members of this task force will speak about the report and the broader issues relevant to open science and scientific organisations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crystal N.

Notably, building a bootstrap distribution requires discussions about sampling and the data acquisition process. A bootstrap distribution can then be used to compute important quantitites: standard error, bias and confidence intervals, which can be discussed using graphical representations of bootstrap distributions. Teaching bootstrap methods also leads to the introduction of robust estimation, because contrary to a popular misconception, bootstrap methods are not robust on their own. Teaching bootstrap methods is an effective way to introduce Monte-Carlo simulations, requiring very little code alteration. Finally, consideration of bootstrap distributions is a great stepping stone to Bayesian posterior distributions, by considering a full distribution of plausible population values as opposed to a few summary statistics.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245920911881","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2021-03-27T12:15:02Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":17794,"title":"Coding Club","startTime":"2021-05-26T13:00","endTime":"2021-05-26T14:00","speaker":"Lisa DeBruine","speakerAffiliation":"","speakerUrl":"https://psyteachr.github.io/shiny-tutorials/coding_club.html","description":"Code along and create a shiny app that simulates and plots data with user-input parameters.

Traditionally, these summary statistics comprise the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the ratings, and the number of observations.  Such summary statistics can preserve the rank order of items, but provide distorted estimates of the relative distances between items because of the ordinal nature of Likert ratings. Inter-item relations in such ordinal scales can be more appropriately modelled by cumulative-link mixed effects models (CLMMs). In a series of simulations, and with a reanalysis of an existing rating norms dataset, we show that CLMMs can be used to more accurately norm items, and can provide summary statistics analogous to the traditionally reported means and SDs, but which are disentangled from participants’ response biases. CLMMs can be applied to solve important statistical issues that exist for more traditional analyses of rating norms.","location":{"id":89,"location":"62 Hillhead Street, Level 5, Seminar Room","directions":"","mapUrl":null,"latitude":0.0,"longitude":0.0},"locationId":89,"owningOu":{"id":141,"parent":85,"name":"Methods & Meta-science","url":"","location":1,"description":"<p>Methods &amp; Meta-science</p>","shortname":"sopsy-mm","status":"ACTIVE","subbed":false},"owningOuId":141,"owningGuid":"adr7m","lastModified":"2021-09-15T12:15:01Z","lastModifiedGuid":"adr7m","registrationUrl":null,"enlightenUrl":null,"intendedAudience":0,"userActionsAllowed":0,"userTagList":[],"subbed":false,"marked":false,"extraLocation":null,"valid":true},{"id":17907,"title":"Coding Club: Writing Data","startTime":"2021-11-17T14:00","endTime":"2021-11-17T15:00","speaker":"Lisa DeBruine","speakerAffiliation":"","speakerUrl":"https://psyteachr.github.io/shiny-tutorials/coding_club.html","description":"We'll be working through the book Building Web Apps with R Shiny to practice and extend the R skills you're learning in methods and stats classes to make a custom web app for searching, visualising and updating data from a Google form.\n\nIn this fourth session, we'll write data from our app to a Google Sheet.
